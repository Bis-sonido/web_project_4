### Overview

* Header
* Profile
  * Form
* Elements
* Footer

**Header**
Simple svg. file as the logo with a solid line underneath it for a sense of separation on the black-background page.

**Profile**

This is where most of the magic happens in regards to button functionality. The profile block consists of three parts: image, profile-info block and a button, this button is yet to have functionality. In the profile-info block, there is an edit button that gives interactivity to the page. it opens a form block that allows you to change the text-content of the profile-info block.

  **form**
The form block is controlled, in terms of display, by using a bit of javascript to allow it to show to the user. This form block has a name input block, an about input block and a save button that allows the user to change the text of the profile-info block. it also has a closing icon to toggle the form out of display.

**Elements**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!
